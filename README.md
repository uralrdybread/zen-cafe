## Zen Cafe

This is a website for a fictitious cafe. It is geared for patrons that would like to drink coffee/tea, eat bread snacks and relax. 
It has an in-house library and selected menu items for either single serving or group gatherings.

The site is fully responsive using bootstrap 5. The top of the site lists the different navigation 
options but when it detects a smaller view it activates a drop-down menu.

Each picture on the home page is situated on the side of the text description but once the view size reaches small it will 
allocate a top-down view for ease of mobile scrolling.
